        <strong class="black">Cookies</strong><br> A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web
        server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the
        server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.
      </p>
      <p>We use both "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies on the website. Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your
        browser. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.</p>
      <p>We will use the session cookies to: keep track of you whilst you navigate the website; prevent fraud and increase website security; We will use the
        persistent cookies to: enable our website to recognise you when you visit; keep track of your preferences in relation to the use of our website;</p>
      <p>We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of this website. Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means
        of cookies, which are stored on users' computers. The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of the
        website. Google will store this information. Google's privacy policy is available at: http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html</p>
